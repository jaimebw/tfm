# Scritps directory
This dir contains the scripts used to run the pipelines. It somewhat similar but to be run directly from terminal, and to be executed as a more data intensive approach.
## File in this dir
* pca_pipeline: PCA anomaly detection pipeline
* pgf_converter: exports all data plot to .pgf format for Latex
* classification_pipline: applies all the binary classification algos to the anomalies
* conv1d_autoencoder_pipline: 1d convolutional autoencoder anomaly detection pipeline
* correlation_matrix: script for plotting the correlation matrix
* feature_extraction: extracts the features from the raw data set
* feature_normalization: normalizes the features for the first IMS dataset from 8 channels to 4
* label_extaction: extracts the labels from the anomaly detection data sets
* lineal_autoencoder_pipline: linbeal autoencoder anomaly detection pipeline 
* pdf_images: obtains images in pdf format for the thesis document
